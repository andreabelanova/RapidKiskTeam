Perfect! I love the clean academic design. Now I need to add character illustrations in the exact flat design style from my uploaded images.

## Character Illustration Requirements

### Visual Style (match uploaded images exactly):
- **Flat geometric design** - simple rounded shapes for bodies
- **Minimal facial features** - small dots for eyes, simple line for mouth
- **Color palette**: Yellow #FFD400, Blue #1E88E5, muted earth tones
- **Clean lines** with no outlines or borders
- **Professional flat illustration style** - corporate/educational look

### Character Design Specifications:
1. **Body shapes**: Rounded rectangles/capsules for torsos
2. **Simple clothing**: Solid color blocks (sweaters, lab coats, business attire)
3. **Hair**: Simple geometric shapes (circles, curves)
4. **Proportions**: Slightly elongated, professional appearance
5. **Poses**: Standing, working at computers, collaborating

### Integration into Current Design:
- Add small character illustrations **next to each card title**
- Characters should be **80-100px tall** 
- Position: **Left side of each card**, with text aligned to the right
- **Subtle drop shadows** to lift them off the background
- Characters should **represent the scenario context**:
  - "I have a team" → 2-3 people collaborating
  - "I don't have a team yet" → Single person with search/networking elements
  - "I don't have a project topic" → Person with research materials, books, lightbulb

### Scene Context Elements:
- **Office/lab environment**: Desks, computers, lab equipment like in uploaded images
- **Collaboration tools**: Whiteboards, charts, meeting spaces
- **Research elements**: Books, papers, laptops
- **Minimal but contextual** - support the narrative without cluttering

## Implementation:
1. **Keep current layout and typography** - it's perfect
2. **Add character illustrations as SVG elements** positioned within each card
3. **Use CSS positioning** to place characters elegantly
4. **Ensure responsive design** - characters scale appropriately on mobile

The goal is to enhance the current clean design with engaging flat illustrations that make each scenario more relatable and visually interesting, while maintaining the professional academic tone.
