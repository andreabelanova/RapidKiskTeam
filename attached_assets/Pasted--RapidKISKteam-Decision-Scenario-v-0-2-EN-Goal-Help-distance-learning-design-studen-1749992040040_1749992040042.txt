# RapidKISKteam – Decision Scenario (v 0.2 • EN)

> **Goal**: Help distance‑learning design students (KISK) solve teamwork problems using the principles of **radical collaboration**.
>
> **Structure**: Each block `### [id]` is a **node**. Bullets `* text → id` are **choices** leading to another node.
>
> **Icon legend** (for later visuals)
>
> * 🔍 = self‑reflection
> * 🤝 = group intervention / workshop
> * 🛠️ = concrete tool or technique
> * 🚩 = warning / escalation
> * ⭐ = positive outcome

## Visual style & identity

* **Flat, easy, playful.** Inspired by the illustrations of **100 method library** (→ [https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/100metod](https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/100metod)).
* The screen centre always shows **one character** in that visual language; choices appear around as bubbles/arrows.
* Palette: primary yellow #FFD400, blue #1E88E5, accents black/white.
* The in‑text icons (🔍 🤝 🛠️ 🚩 ⭐) can later be replaced by matching pictograms.

## Routing conventions

If a node doesn’t state an explicit target, apply:

| Outcome type                | Target end          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| ⭐ Success / progress        | `continue_project`  |
| 🚩 Needs external advice    | `seek_help`         |
| ❌ Failure / breakup / pivot | `project_cancelled` |

> Ensures every node reaches one of the agreed ends.
