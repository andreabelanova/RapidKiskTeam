# Visual Redesign Prompt Based on 100metod Style

```
I need to completely redesign the visual style based on this reference: https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/100metod

## Target Visual Style (100metod inspired)
- CLEAN minimalist design with lots of white space
- Simple typography - clean sans-serif fonts
- Subtle colors: mainly white background with blue #1E88E5 and yellow #FFD400 accents
- No fancy gradients or heavy graphics
- Text-focused with simple visual hierarchy
- Professional academic look, not game-like

## Layout Requirements
1. **Clean grid system** like 100metod:
   - Large white background
   - Generous spacing between all elements (40px+)
   - Simple text-based navigation
   - Minimal visual clutter

2. **Choice cards should be simple text blocks**:
   - White background with subtle border
   - Large readable text (18px+)
   - Hover effects: light blue/yellow highlight
   - No complex illustrations inside cards
   - Focus on clear, descriptive text

3. **Header area**:
   - Clean title "RapidKISK Team" 
   - Subtitle explaining the purpose
   - Simple back navigation (just text link, not button)

## Character Illustrations (if any)
- Remove complex character cards
- Use simple abstract icons or shapes
- Minimal flat design elements
- Professional academic style, not cartoon-like
- Icons should be subtle, secondary to text content

## Color & Typography
- PRIMARY: Clean white background
- ACCENTS: Blue #1E88E5 for interactive elements
- SECONDARY: Yellow #FFD400 for highlights only
- Typography: Clean, readable sans-serif
- Larger font sizes for better readability
- Proper text hierarchy with clear contrast

## Overall Transformation - "Academic Game"
Transform to an elegant "academic game" that combines engagement with sophistication:
- Keep interactive game elements but make them refined
- Maintain scenario-based navigation but cleaner
- Educational tool that feels engaging, not dry
- Sophisticated visual storytelling for adult learners
- Balance between serious academic content and interactive engagement

## Refined Game Elements
- Keep character selection but make it more sophisticated
- Elegant hover animations (subtle, not bouncy)
- Clean progress indication through the scenarios
- Refined color-coded themes for different situation types
- Professional illustrations that support learning objectives

Please redesign as a sophisticated "academic game" - engaging but refined, educational but interactive.
